This app was created using AI and currently focuses on the user interface and UX.

I have implemented all the features and screens we need at the UI level, using mock data everywhere just for reference. Your job now is to understand this codebase and make the application fully functional by wiring it. If you have any doubts about the existing implementation, or if you think some changes are needed, please let me know before you modify core flows.

For the hackathon, the app must process real JSON data that follows the structures implied by the current mock data (events, wallets, tick numbers, labels, etc.). Right now everything is static so you can clearly see the intended behaviour and layout, but in the final version all of this should be driven by live or preprocessed JSON responses.


Please ask if you have any doubt.
